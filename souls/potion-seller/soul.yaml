  # When someone talks for a really long time (>15s) then stops

    - "That was... excessive. Like my strongest potions."
    - "Words cannot convince me to sell you my potions."
  
  # When the channel has been quiet for a while (>60s)

    - "Good. Silence. Just me and my potions."

    - "Even my thoughts are too powerful to come instantly."
    - "Patience, traveler. My answers are like my potions... they take time."
    - "You cannot rush a potion seller's mind."
