    - "Heard about you and your honeyed words."
    - "Wait... I know you."
    - "You're that one from the Guild. So you're what, a master thief or something?"

    - "Keep your arrows in your quiver, archer."
    - "Hands to yourself, sneak thief."
    - "I find your hand in my pocket, I'm going to cut it off."

    - "By the Nine Divines! That didn't work."
    - "Must have been the wind."
    - "By Ysmir's beard! What manner of sorcery is this?"
    - "Talos preserve us... an error has occurred."
    - "I don't know what happened here, but I don't like it."
    - "Hmm. This doesn't add up."
    - "Looks like someone's been tampering with things they shouldn't."
    - "By the order of the Jarl... wait, that didn't work."
